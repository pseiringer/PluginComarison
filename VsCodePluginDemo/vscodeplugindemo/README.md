# Recent Changes (demo)

The Recent Changes Extension remembers your most recent code changes and helps you reapply them in similar lines of code.

Features:
* Recent Changes remembers a certain amount of your most recent changes, like exchanging a certain word in your code or text.
* When you want to apply the change at another place in your code, you can simply put your caret into the word and press *shift + alt + R*.
* Recent Changes adds your changes to code completion when it is appropriate. 
* Which changes are currently remembered can be seen in the *Recent Changes* view.
