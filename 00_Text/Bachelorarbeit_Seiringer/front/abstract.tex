Working with IDEs can be vastly improved by plugins
or extensions. However, the decision for which IDE
a plugin should be developed, is (especially without any
previous experience) far from trivial.

Therefore, the extension APIs in Visual Studio Code and 
IntelliJ IDEA will be analysed and compared. In order
to make this comparison, a catalog of criteria will be created,
against which the two systems can be measured.

In order to create a practical basis for the comparison,
a prototypical plugin will be developed for both platforms.
Based on the experiences made while developing this 
prototype, the criteria can be evaluated and compared.
With the help of the aquired knowledge, an effective
basis for decision-making can be created for
new plugin developers.
