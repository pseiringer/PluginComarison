Working with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 
can be vastly improved by plugins
or extensions. For example, they allow for automation 
of development tasks, or for integration of additional development
tools into the existing development environment.
However, the decision for which IDE
a plugin should be developed, is (especially without any
previous experience) far from trivial. For this decision,
it is advantageous to have a fundamental knowledge of
the API functionality and the development of such
plugins and extensions.

Therefore, the extension APIs in Visual Studio Code and 
IntelliJ IDEA will be analysed and compared. In particular,
the structure and API functionality, together with
their testability and publishing methods, will be investigated.
In order to make a comparison, a catalog of criteria will be created,
against which the two systems can be evaluated.

In order to create a practical basis for the comparison,
a prototypical plugin will be developed for both platforms.
Based on the experiences made while developing this 
prototype, the criteria can be evaluated and compared.
With the help of the acquired knowledge, an effective
basis for decision-making can be created for
new plugin developers and the entry into plugin development
can be facilitated.
